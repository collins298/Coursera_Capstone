    "The world has become one giant global village and thus, each and every minute, people travel from one place to another. \n",

    "When people live in a particular region for a long time, they tend to embrace the cultures (e.g food, clothing, language etc) of that region,\n",
    "making it very difficult to transition into other neighborhoods. For example, a person who loves seafood and attend yoga classes will want to\n",
